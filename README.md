# URL Classification using BERT

## Project Overview

This project implements a URL classification system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to categorize URLs into four classes: benign, defacement, malware, and phishing. The system processes URLs, extracts features, and uses a BERT-based model for classification.

## Components

The project consists of three main scripts:

1. `ThreadingIPNSextaract.py`: Extracts features from URLs, including IP addresses and nameservers.
2. `URLfeatureRanking.py`: Performs additional feature engineering on the extracted URL data.
3. `URLclassifier.py`: Implements the BERT-based classifier for URL classification.

## Features

- URL processing and feature extraction
- DNS resolution for IP addresses and nameservers
- Advanced feature engineering (KL divergence, entropy, suspicious word detection, etc.)
- BERT-based classification model
- Multi-threaded processing for improved performance
- Model saving and loading capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- dnspython

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nagarjuna278/URLClassification.git
   cd URLClassification
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your URL dataset in a CSV file named `malicious_phish.csv` with columns 'url' and 'type'.

2. Run the URL processing and feature extraction:
   ```
   python ThreadingIPNSextract.py
   ```

3. Perform feature engineering:
   ```
   python URLfeatureRanking.py
   ```

4. Train and evaluate the BERT classifier:
   ```
   python URLclassifier.py
   ```

## Model

The project uses a pre-trained BERT model (`bert-base-uncased`) fine-tuned for URL classification. The model is trained on a balanced dataset of URLs with four classes: benign, defacement, malware, and phishing.

## Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Saving and Loading the Model

The trained model is automatically saved to the `bert_url_classifier` directory. You can load the saved model for future use or deployment.
